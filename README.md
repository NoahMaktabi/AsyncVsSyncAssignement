<h1>Async Vs normal execute</h1>
A console application that demonstrates the difference between performing executions synchronously and asynchronously. 
The app presents a menu that shows different choices. You can choose to perform async execution or normal. 
Both tasks perform the exact same thing. The key difference is that async programming is implemented in one and not the other. 
But they both access HttpClient and downloads many websites as strings, then shows how many characters the sites contain. 
At last they show how much time it took to perform the task. 

After executing both, you can see a remarkable difference in speed when performing the same task with async implemented.
